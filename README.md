# Deep-Learning-Lab
## According to Syllabus
1. Familiarize basic python packages for deep learning such as Keras,
Tensorflow etc.

2. Data pre-processing operations such as outliers and/or inconsis-
tent data value
management. **

3. Implement Feed forward neural network with three hidden layers
for classification on CIFAR-10 dataset.**

4. Analyse the impact of optimization and weight initialization tech-
niques such as Xavier initialization, Kaiming Initialization, dropout
and regularization techniques and visualize the change in perform-
ance. **

5. Digit classification using CNN architecture for MNIST dataset. **

6. Digit classification using pre-trained networks like VGGnet-19 for
MNIST dataset and analyse and visualize performance improve-
ment.**

7. Implement a simple RNN for review classification using IMDB data-
set.**

8. Analyse and visualize the performance change while using LSTM
and GRU instead of simple RNN.**
